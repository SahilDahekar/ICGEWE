## About the Project

As a freelance web developer, I had the privilege of working on a project that holds great significance: the **International Conference for Gender Equality and Women Empowerment**. The conference was scheduled to take place from **March 07 2023** to **March 08 2023**, and it was hosted at **PVGCOET**.

### The Challenge

My mission was to design and develop a website that not only showcased the essence of the conference but also served as a powerful tool for its promotion, registration, and communication.

### Achievements

Here's what we accomplished together:

- **Increased Registration**: The website that I created led to a remarkable 10% increase in conference registrations. It's inspiring to see technology making a real impact on such an important cause.

- **Timely Updates**: Keeping the conference attendees informed was crucial. The website became the central hub for timely updates, ensuring that participants were always in the loop about the latest developments.

## The Conference

The International Conference for Gender Equality and Women Empowerment was a platform where thought leaders, activists, researchers, and change-makers came together to share their insights and work towards a more equitable world. The event featured keynote speakers, engaging panel discussions, interactive workshops, and valuable networking opportunities.

### The Technologies I Used

- **ReactJS**: I leveraged the power of ReactJS to build an interactive and dynamic website that was both functional and visually appealing.

- **CSS**: Custom styling was applied to ensure that the design aligned perfectly with the conference's values and goals.

- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and essential functionalities were implemented using JavaScript, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Netlify**: The website was hosted on Netlify, guaranteeing optimal performance and 24/7 availability.
